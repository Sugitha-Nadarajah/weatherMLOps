WEATHERMLOPS 

📌 About the project : 
This repository is a personal learning project to practice and improve my skills in:
- CI/CD pipelines (Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment)
- Dockerization
- GitHub Actions

The project is a small Python application that:
- Calls the WeatherAPI to fetch the current weather based on your IP location.
- Retrieves and displays the daily forecast (temperature, rain chance, wind, humidity, etc.).
- It is not meant for production use but as a way to experiment with automation and DevOps practices.

⚙️ Features :
- 🌍 Detects your location automatically via IP.
- ☀️ Shows the current weather conditions.
- 📅 Displays today’s forecast, including hourly predictions.
-🧪 Integrated with pytest for testing.
- 🔄 Automated workflows with GitHub Actions.
- 🐳 Docker support (in progress).
